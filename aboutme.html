    <div class="aboutme 1">Hey, I'm a 15 year old Student from Queensland. I have been into computers since I was 8 and bulit my first computer at the age of 10.</h4>
    <div class="aboutme 2">My Coding Background: I started to code back in early 2020 when covid hit and started learning Python to use for a Discord Bot. I've grown from Discord bots to creating Monitors (aka Stock Alert Bots). I now own and maintain 3 Stock Alert Twitters with a combined following of 14.5k. I have helped thousands of people get PS5s or Rapid Antigen Test.</div>
    <div class="aboutme 3">My Past Jobs: When I turned 15 I wanted to look for a Job and managed to get one at my local McDonalds. Whilst working there I continued to learn and grow my understanding of Coding. I was your average Maccas employee making the minimum wage for working hard.</div>
    <div class="aboutme 4">What got me into Stock Alerts: I was never a console gamer / user, one day my friend said lets get PS5s to be able to play together. My mate managed to get one and I still had not. I thought to my self why not use my Python experience to create a Monitor to keep watch of the PS5s. That knowledge managed to get me one and now I use it to help others.</div>
    <div class="aboutme 5">Did PS5Australia start well: Not a chance, being my first Monitors I only had the basics. I would get banned on Amazon and Target and had not reset my modem multiple times, Target and Amazon's rate-limit (I go to the site too much) would mess up my detection. After work I looked at my phone and saw I had lots of people mad at my false alerting, I lost 200 followers and only had 500 at the time.</div>
    <div class="aboutme 6">What do you do to this day: I still work on fixing and improving my Python bots. I also started learning HTML, JS, and CSS which is the reason we are all using this site. Being self-employed I get the freedom to do anything I want! I also keep watch and assist people with questions on my Twitter and Discord. I also play games like Valorant, GTA and Battlefield.</div>
